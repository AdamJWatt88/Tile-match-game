                    To-do
****************************************************



9) Fix when a user clicks too fast on a single tile. When clicked too fast it registers as a match. This is because the .slide is still available to click and hasn't been removed quick enough for the user to NOT click it.

10) Fix the overall style of the game. It looks pretty drab at the moment.

14) Add a start screen that asks for a difficulty. This screen will make a choice to have 20,30, or 40 tiles. The sizes are still yet to be determined as to what will fit on screens.

15) Add a gameover screen with a choice to replay.

16) Fix grid to fit on small mobile phone screens

17) Fix scrolling issue on mobile when a phone is turned sideways.



            Finished plans/to-do
*****************************************************

1) Need to loop through the images array TWICE and push them into an array as objects that bring along the image as well as the id. This way there is two of each image. So an array of objects {id: value, image: value}.

1b) Can alternatively hardwire two images for each image to avoid trying to figure out the double loop or multiplying of each image twice.

2) The array that is created needs to be randomized. This insures that everytime i loop over it and create the div elements to insert into the DOM the images will then be randomized.

3) The id needs to be attached to the div containing the image as the id attribute or the data attribute so that matching the id can be done when two items are selected. The data attribute is currently attached to the img tag.

4) Make image the .tile background-image and add the id to the slide

5) Fix the openSlide() so that only the clicked tile is opened instead of all .slide.

6) Start logic for match up of id for .slide

7) Fix the opening and closing of the .slide. Make it a smoother open and close. Set the z-index to -1 if a match is made so the .slide 'disappears'. Or removes the .slide altogether after a match is made.
Check notes for z-index and the article that explains why it might not be working.

8) Add the scoring for matched slides and if they match remove the 
.slide

11) The game contaier is not exactly centered and the right side of the tiles has a big empty margin

12) Fix the hover ease css. When the hover ease is written in it overrides the ease of the original slide's ease property. Tiles start flying off the screen really fast

13) Add more pictures to fill the gameboard. On fullscreen the board is only two rows.
